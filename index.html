                <h1>Childhood</h1>
                <p>I was born, 24 June 1987, in Rosario, Argentina to a working-class family. 
                    My father was a factory steel worker, and my mother a cleaner. I began 
                    playing from an early age, and my talent was soon apparent. However, 
                    at the age of 11, I was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). 
                    This was a condition that stunted growth and required expensive medical 
                    treatment, including the use of the drug Human growth hormone. My local
                    club, River Plate were interested in signing me but didn’t want to pay 
                    for my medical treatment. However, I was given a trial with Barcelona, 
                    and coach Carles Rexach was impressed – offering me a contract (written 
                    on a paper napkin!) which included paying for my treatment in Spain. 
                    I moved to Barcelona with my father and became part of the prestigious 
                    FC Barcelona youth academy.

                <h1>Barcelona</h1>
                <p>In October 2004, I made my official debut for the first team against
                   RCD Espanyol, becoming the third-youngest player ever to play for FC Barcelona. 
                   When I scored my first senior goal for the club against Albacete Balompie on 
                   May 1, 2005, I was 17 years, 10 months and 7 days old, becoming the youngest 
                   to ever score in a La Liga game for FC Barcelona.

                <h1>Argentina</h1>
                <p>As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, I was eligible to play for the
                   national team of both countries.[330] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad 
                   began pursuing me in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles 
                   Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. 
                   I declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since 
                   childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking me, the Argentine Football 
                   Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay 
                   and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising my status as an Argentina player 
                   in FIFA. Five days after my 17th birthday, on 29 June, I made my debut for 
                   my country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in our 
                   8–0 victory.

                <h1>Personal life</h1>
                <p>Since 2008, I have been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow 
                   native of Rosario. I have knew Roccuzzo since I was five years old, as she 
                   is the cousin of my childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a 
                   football player. After keeping our relationship private for a year, I first
                   confirmed our romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public 
                   a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.
                   Me and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and 
                   Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate my partner's first pregnancy, I placed the 
                   ball under my shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on
                   2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. 
                   Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with me attending the birth
                   after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training. Thiago's name and
                   handprints are tattooed on my left calf. In April 2015, I confirmed that we 
                   were expecting another child. I missed training ahead of a match against 
                   Atlético Madrid to attend the birth of my second son, Mateo, on 11 September 
                   2015 in Barcelona. On 30 June 2017, I married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named
                   Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending my wedding. On 
                   15 October 2017, my wife announced we were expecting our third child. On 10 
                   March 2018, I skipped the match against Málaga after Ciro was born.
